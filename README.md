Round Robin Basic Time Calculator Algorithm

To execute it you need a c++ compiler, g++ is recomended

Run the following command:

      g++ main.cpp -o main
  
Then run:

      ./main

You will be prompted to enter the number of processes, and their burst time or time they need to be completed.

The time for the quantum is set to 2 by default.

The code was implemented using the code presented in this article from Geeks For Geeks:

Some modifications were made to allow reading input from the user to set the number of processes and their respective burst times
